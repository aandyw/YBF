## Usage


### Using the Chat Widget SDK
*Experimental -- Not working yet...*

To embed the Your Biggest Fan chatbot into your own web application, follow these steps:

1.  **Install the YBF Chat Widget SDK:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install @aandyw/ybf
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    Copy over `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in any necessary environment variables.
    *  OpenAI is used as the embedding model and Gemini 2.5 Flash is the chat model.

3.  **Integrate the Widget:**
    You can now import and initialize the `ChatWidgetSDK` in your JavaScript/TypeScript application.
    ```typescript
    import ChatWidgetSDK from 'ybf';

    useEffect(() => {
      const ybfChat = new ChatWidgetSDK({
        subjectName: "George P. Thompson", // The name of the person the chatbot is hyping up
        // Optional configurations:
        height: "520px",
        width: "380px",
        position: "bottom-right", // or "bottom-left", "top-right", "top-left"
        openByDefault: false,
        initialMessages: ["Yo, I'm here to glaze."],
        numHistoryMessages: 3,
        systemPrompt: "You are a helpful assistant that provides information.",
      });

      ybfChat.init();
    }, []);

    // To remove the widget later:
    // ybfChat.destroy();
    ```

4.  **Index Your Resume Content (Crucial for Chatbot Context):**
    The chatbot requires your resume content to function effectively.
    *   Place your resume content (e.g., PDF, Text, etc.) in `data/` (under your project root).
    *   Run:
        ```bash
        pnpm run generate
        ```
        This command processes your resume content and prepares it for the chatbot to use as context.
